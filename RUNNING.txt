Please include clear and simple instructions for running your project.

The makefile should work properly for executing the program with all of the
tests as long as binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi and qemu arm are installed
using the commands:

    sudo apt-get install binutils-arm-linux-gnuabi
    sudo apt-get install qemu-system

These tools are need to assemble and link the ARM files properly and then run
them using the emulator (qemu-arm-static). The files are assembled using the
command arm-linux-gnueabi-as and arm-linux-gnueabi-ld. 

To run the program use the command "make clean test". Otherwise the Makefile
works the same way as they were given to us in our previous projects since it is
just a modified version of p5's Makefile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain why your supplied tests illustrate that your project works

Our supplied tests illustrate that our project works correctly because we
essentially recycled the tests from p5. They use print statements to verify that
the compiled version prints and runs correctly. They basically test boolean
expression, arithmetic expressions, recursion, while loops, if statements, and
the other various functionalities of fun. If the ARM file runs correctly, then
the corresponding output should be the same as what is in the .ok file.
